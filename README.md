**Overview:**
This Python script offers automation functionality for controlling character movement within Roblox games. By simulating keypresses, it enables repetitive actions such as movement and jumping, facilitating gameplay automation.

**Features:**

1. **Interval Configuration:** Users have the option to set either random intervals or fixed intervals between actions, providing flexibility in automation pacing.
   
2. **Action Selection:** The script allows users to specify the type of actions to be automated, including movement keys (forward, backward, left, right), and the jump key.
   
3. **Customizable Keys:** Key configurations can be easily modified according to the specific requirements of different Roblox games.

**How to Use:**

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure Python is installed on your system along with the required libraries - `keyboard` and `time`.

2. **Configure Script:**
    - Run the script and follow the prompts to select interval type (random or fixed) and the mode of actions (all keys, movement keys, or jump key).
    - If choosing a fixed interval, input the desired interval in seconds.

3. **Execute Script:** After configuration, execute the script. It will automate the specified actions at the configured intervals.

**Note:** 
- Make sure to run the script in the same environment where the Roblox game is active.
- Usage of automation scripts in online games may be against the terms of service of certain platforms. Use discretion and ensure compliance with the game's policies.
- The author is not responsible for any consequences, including but not limited to account bans or penalties, resulting from the use of this script.
